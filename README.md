# Antigravity Vibe-Coding Experiment: SharpLens

This project is an **antigravity based vibe-coding experiment** meant to implement a more extended and general event browser.

At the moment, it is tested against the **sharpino** template, with some changes to demonstrate the capabilities.

## Goal

The ultimate goal of this project is to create a **general event browser** capable of:
*   Handling **multiple commands** that act against **multiple streams**.
*   Adapting to **application layer services** that may expose **complex logic** related to those multiple streams.

This tool aims to provide deep insight and control over event-sourced systems, transcending simple CRUD operations to fully embrace the complexity of distributed, event-driven architectures.
